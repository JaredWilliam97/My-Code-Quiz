- This project is to create a Code Quiz using Html, CSS, and Javascript trying to utilize all the skills that I have learned in this class.

"\*" In this project I am creating a code quiz. I created the html first, to get the basic layout. I then used CSS to style the page the way I wanted it. Then finally I used Javscript to make the Code Quiz functional.

There were some features to my website that I think will stand out. I created some pictures that go along with the quiz.

As I built my website I used comments to help others reading to be able to understand it better.

This was a fun project but very challenging, because this is the first time using Javascript. I have learned alot so far and excited to learn more!
